Greater Than Less Than Mini CHallenge #4
Peer Review: Brandon Le - The program works properly as intended. I was able to get the proper answers for greater than, less than, and equals to no matter what numbers I was entering. The data validation for yes or no worked well and it kept looping I was able to play again and also end the program. The only thing I would say is if you have the time it would be cool to add in data validation after each input of an invalid number instead of having the user start all over. So for example if I wrote Brandon for the first input it would send me to the next user input even though I didn't put a number in for the first user input. But that's just extra if you had time or wanted to try and make it work. Otherwise the program worked really well. Good job! :)
